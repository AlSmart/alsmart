# Impact of Covid-19 on Air Quality 

## 🧩 Business Context
During the COVID-19 pandemic, governments introduced unprecedented lockdown measures that dramatically altered human behavior, transportation, and economic activity. 
This created a rare opportunity for decision-makers to understand how policy interventions directly influence environmental outcomes.
This project investigates the relationship between COVID-19 lockdown measures and air quality, specifically focusing on Carbon Monoxide (CO) emissions. 
By integrating pandemic data with environmental metrics, our team analyzed how shifts in human activity influenced pollution levels across various U.S. states and counties between 2019 and 2023.
